USAGE
Copy the quotes/ directory to somewhere in your PYTHONPATH, and add
"quotes" to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.

You will also need to create a file named quotes_config.py in your path. This
file should contain a list/tuple named quotes, which contains tuples of the
form (quote as a unicode object, author, reference url), e.g.:

    quotes = (
        (u'INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER', 'Multivac',
         'http://multivax.com/last_question.html'),
        ...
    )

Then, place the following code where the tag should be displayed:
    {% load quotes %} {% random_quote %}
